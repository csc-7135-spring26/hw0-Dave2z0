\## What I learned

1. I learned GitHub is used to collaborate and maintain history of projects.
2. I learned what a repository is and how committing and pushing basically means how one can add the changes made on their local machine to the remote repository in GitHub.
3. I learned about branches and how thy can be used to isolate work you don't want to be merged yet. This is good to know as it means I can experiment on different codes without being afraid of ruining the existing or original code.
4. I also learned about markdowns and this is the first time I've actually done one on GitHub.



\## What I am Confused about

1. The branches, I'm currently not sure how all this works, I know I have to commit my changes for it to update, but after committing does it just add to the documentation or does it actually cause changes in the original code.
2. I'm still confused on how merges work, I know this probably sounds like my first confusion, but I'd still like clarification and practice on that.
